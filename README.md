# Learning to Paint with Diffusion Model
**Diffusion models** are generative models that create images by gradually refining random noise into detailed and coherent visuals.
For generating natural landscape scenes in the **Studio Ghibli style**, diffusion models learn from a collection of Ghibli-inspired artwork, capturing their distinctive soft color palettes, watercolor textures, and atmospheric lighting.
This enables the model to synthesize new images that evoke the warm, nostalgic, and hand-painted feel characteristic of Ghibli films, blending fantasy with nature in a harmonious way.
## Data
The project uses the pre-trained model [**_Diffuser_**](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers?tab=readme-ov-file) as the core for generating natural landscape images with the iconic Studio Ghibli art style. 
The model generates images with a resolution of _704x512_ pixels, featuring diverse natural landscapes including forests, beaches, mountains, and various weather conditions such as sunny, snowy, and starry nights, capturing the rich and atmospheric essence of Studio Ghibliâ€™s visual style.

## Training
The model was fine-tuned from [**_OpenAI's improved-diffusion_**](https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion/tree/main) model for using _20k_ training steps. This fine-tuning process adapted the original diffusion model to better capture the unique artistic style and diverse natural landscapes characteristic of Studio Ghibli, enhancing its ability to generate high-quality images in this specific style.
The fine-tuned model in this project produces images at a resolution of _256x256_ pixels. 
## Examples
In my experiments, I tried fine-tuning the model with landscape scenes that included humans. However, the generated images of people were unrealistic and somewhat distorted. This was mainly due to the poor quality and insufficient diversity of the training data related to human figures. As a result, I decided to focus the training exclusively on natural landscapes to ensure higher quality and more coherent image generation.
